# Weather-Journal App Project
Welcome to my second final project in web development professional track, The Weather-Journal App Project.

## Overview
This Weather-Journal App Project is about an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI showing the temperature of the city that you have inserted it's Zip Code, I have chosen USA Country to test on it.

## Table of Contents
The project consists of three parts:
    - node_modules
    - website
      - app.js
      - index.html
      - style.css
    - package.json
    - README.md
    - server.js
    - yarn.lock

## Instructions
    1. First of all, we must install cors, express and body-parser.
    2. We may install it using npm or yarn, I have chosen yarn. 
    3. Determine in which server the project will be run on, I have chosen port 8080.
    4. Using two functions get and post, get to get the data, post to send the data.
    5. We have to get our unique API key, so I have made an account on openweathermap so i can get it.
    6. Also we used openweathermap web to get the zip code information using also the API.
    7. To run the app, you first have to run node server.js in your terminal, then open http://localhost:8080

## Extras
    1. I have chosen USA cities to test the weather there.
    2. You can get the zip code of any city by google it.
    3. If the zip code is wrong there will be an alarm that the zip code is not exist
    4. The results of the city that you have entered it's zip code wil be shown dynamically in Most Recent Entry box.
